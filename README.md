Installation
================

*Warning*, this software project uses lots of uncommon requirements, so it can be a bit tricky to install. 
I have tried to documented all the steps required in the scripts/Dockerfile if you want a manual install if you do not wish to run Docker.

Watch Leafo's Lapis screencast to get familiar with Lapis <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo67iTY1Yf8>
It includes information that is relevant to this development process.

A Dockerfile is provided to get the project with all its requirements quickly up and running


Build the image

    $ docker build -t torhve/pix scripts/

This will build a complete docker image with all the requirements installed, database setup, and everything included.

You can then run it:

    $ docker run -i -p 8080:8080 -t torhve/pix

The -p 8080:8080 argument exposes the container port 8080 to the host port 8080 on interface 0.0.0.0

If you want to configure or further hack you can use this command to get a bash prompt inside the docker image

    $ docker run -i -p 8080:8080 -t torhve/pix bash

Hacking
=======

Docker lets you share a directory from the host to the container using the *-v* argument, so if you want to hack on the source you can check out the source on the host as you usually would do and then share the directory to the container like this:

    $ docker run -i -p 8080:8080 -t torhve/pix -v /home/tor/projects/pix:/pix

This maps the directory /home/tor/projects/pix to the container directory /pix.

Then you would want to install <http://gittup.org/tup/> on the host to automatically compile MoonScript to Lua and LESS to CSS.
I could not get tup working inside the docker since it requires FUSE filesystem which did not work in the container.

Tup installation on Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-add-repository 'deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/anatol/tup/ubuntu lucid main'
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install tup

Tup first time:

    cd /home/tor/projects/pix
    tup init
    tup upd

Tup each time:

    tup monitor -a


If you do not want to run Redis and PostgreSQL inside the container, but rather on the host itself you have to get the postgresql daemon and the redis daemon to listen on the docker0 interface IP on the host. And then have the container configuration connect to the docker0 IP for redis and postgresql.



PIX Configuration is in etc/config.json and config.moon

Deployment
==========

Use nginx with proxy_pass (or similar) to the exposed lapis port.
You can then start a different lapis configuration like this:

    $ docker run -i -p 8181:8080 -v=/home/tor/src/pix:/pix -w=/pix -t torhve/pix lapis server production
